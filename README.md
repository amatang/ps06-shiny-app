# User Documentation

## Overview
The dataset used in this Shiny web app displays happiness metrics across different countries from 2018-2019.
Metrics such as _Social support_ and _Healthy life expectancy_ can correlated to the country's happiness score.

## Tabs, Widgets, and Panels
There are three tabs in this app: **About**, **Plots**, and **Tables**.

### About
The **About** tab gives general information about the dataset to the user. The side panel explains what this app does and provides a quick summary about the dataset. The main panel contains a table of a random sample of 5 countries. 

### Plots
The **Plots** tab displays a scatterplot of the relationship between _Social support_ and _Score_. This plot is displayed in the main panel. The side panel describes what the user is seeing. In addition, widgets are provided in the side panel. The _**Sample Size Slider**_ widget allows users to change the random sample size in the scatterplot. The _**Color Palette Changer**_ permits users to change the plot point's color scheme.

### Tables
The **Tables** tab presents a table of different countries and their averages. The _Average_ column calculates the average of a given variable for each country. The main panel holds the table. The side panel explains the widget's purpose and its effect on the table. The _**Variable Selection**_ widget gives users the ability to pick a numeric attribute (that is, the variable). Once the user selects a variable, it will calculate the average of that specific variable for each country.
